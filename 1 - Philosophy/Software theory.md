# The theory of five

## Introduction
Today's software programs tend to be overcomplicated, inefficient, and unsecure. There are examples : macOS, which was vastly critisized for its bugs and security breaches, Windows, which is known for its slowness, security problems, and overcomplicated architecture, Minecraft, which has huge performance issues... To only name a few. They are, however, well-etablished software that is used all across the world. How is it possible to determine the quality of a software? This paper proposes five criteria, which determine the necessary qualities of good software.

## The five criteria
These criteria are :
* Security
* Speed
* Simplicity
* Flexibility
* [FIXME: I forgot...]

They are listed by importance, from the most important to the least. Security is, of course, placed first. Speed follows, and that, because it matters more than what could be though. Effectively, inefficient software not only take more time to complete execution, it also holds resources which could have been given to other tasks, which may be more important. Furthermore, efficient software tends to work more easily on old or low-end software, making software efficiency fights planned obsolescence. Simplicity come from a well-known proverb from the \*NIX world : KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid). Simplicity in software is directly related to our human nature : it is a lot easier to program well-organized and simple software than overcomplicated ones, with a very complicated architecture. Also, security problems and bugs tend to be more easily fixed on a simple program than on a very complicated one... However, some programs *do* need complex architecture : but in that case, the program is complex, and not complicated. Flexibility is harder to define. It means that software should use as much universal and general systems as possible, and avoid using any unnecessary systems. Each of them will be described in details below.

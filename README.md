# AvalancheOS
A free, fast and user-friendly operating system

## What is this?
It's currently an idea, a concept of what an almost perfect operating system would look like. I know that, by design, perfection doesn't exist, and that's why it's not the only operating system in the world. In a nutshell, it is an operating system made from scratch, with security, speed, simplicity and flexibility in mind. It makes use of some new, uncommon and experimental concepts to try to achieve one of the best OS experience in the world, today. But it is not only an operating system, it is also an experience to show what good software is, and how to create it. This documentation is the first step toward it.

## Will it ever be real?
In short : probaly no. As anyone who ever looked into operating systems knows, this is one of the hardest - if not the hardest - software to create. But AvalancheOS is not only an operating system, it's also an idea, a concept, a philosophy, which will be contained in this documentation. So probably no, but this is a step forward.

## Sounds cool, but... Why?
You're right. There's plenty of other operating systems out there that are all very cool, full of features and widely used. But, as anything is, they're not perfect.

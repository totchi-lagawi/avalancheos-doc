No application do whatever it likes on the computer : they all are sandboxed directly by the kernel, with only some system applications (mostly coming from `/system`, so impossible to modify) being treated as "trusted", thus allowed to do anything without restrictions (other than the ones added by abstractions like the concept of users and file permissions). Sandboxing go far, preventing any application to know anything about the currently running system or even the computer, like hiding the process tree, most of the virtual filesystem, the devices currently connected... Making all of them running in small separated containers, a bit like on Android, while Android allows too much things.
